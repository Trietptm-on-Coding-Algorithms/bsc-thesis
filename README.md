# Symbolic Execution and Debugging Synchronization

This is my Bsc thesis.

> In this thesis, we introduce the idea of combining symbolic execution with dynamic analysis for reverse engineering. The synchronization between a debugger and a symbolic executor can enhance manual dynamic analysis and allow a reverser to easily solve small portions of code without leaving the debugger. We implemented a synchronization mechanism on top of the binary analysis framework angr. This means a method to transfer the state of the debugged process in the angr environment and back. The backend library is debugger agnostic and can be extended to work with various frontends. We implemented a frontend for the IDA Pro debugger and one for the GNU Debugger.
