# Symbolic Execution and Debugging Synchronization

This is my Bsc thesis.

>In this thesis, we introduce the idea of combining symbolic execution with dynamic analysis for reverse engineering.
>The synchronization between a debugger and a symbolic executor can enhance manual dynamic analysis and allow a reverser to easily solve small portions of code without leaving the debugger.
>We implemented a synchronization mechanism on top of the binary analysis framework angr, allowing for transferring the state of the debugged process to the angr environment and back.
>The backend library is debugger agnostic and can be extended to work with various frontends.
>We implemented a frontend for the IDA Pro debugger and one for the GNU Debugger, which are both widely popular among reverse engineers.
